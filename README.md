# OpenGuide-Assist: An Open-Source Door-to-Vehicle-to-Door Guidance System

OpenGuide-Assist is a wearable assistive device based on the Intel OAK-D camera. The goal is to leverage RGB and depth data in order to detect obstacles and convey them to a person with visual impairments. The current version supports 3D obstacle and vehicle part detection models, which are used to provide audio-haptic guidance. For audio, a bluetooth connection is supported. For haptic, please see our design below involving a Raspberry Pi module.
